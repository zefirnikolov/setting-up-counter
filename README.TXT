The purpose of this very simple github workflow is to create a base for docker container registry tags updates:

download the github repo in which there is a file named counter.txt (there is only 1 integer in this file for example 3, nothing else) - after that it reads the file with cat and create an environment variable called ENV_VAR - which is a sum of the integer in the file + 1 - in our example 3+1=4 So the ENV_VAR should be 4. After that it modifies the file to become the value of the ENV_VAR and nothing else, in this case 4, and then push the updated repo to github, so after the change the counter.txt content is 4. The event is on push, and the VM is ubuntu-latest


the echo "ENV_VAR=$($(cat counter.txt) + 1)" >> $GITHUB_ENV  command:

The command echo "ENV_VAR=$(\$(cat counter.txt) + 1)" >> $GITHUB_ENV creates an environment variable called ENV_VAR and sets its value to the result of the expression $(($(cat counter.txt) + 1)).

The expression $(cat counter.txt) reads the content of the file counter.txt and returns it as a string. The outer $((...)) is an arithmetic expansion that evaluates the expression inside it. In this case, it takes the value read from counter.txt, converts it to an integer, adds 1 to it, and returns the result.

The echo command then outputs the string "ENV_VAR=value" where value is the result of the arithmetic expansion. The >> $GITHUB_ENV part of the command appends this output to the file specified by the $GITHUB_ENV environment variable. This file is used by GitHub Actions to set environment variables for the workflow.

So, in summary, this command reads the value from counter.txt, adds 1 to it, creates an environment variable called ENV_VAR, and sets its value to the result.
